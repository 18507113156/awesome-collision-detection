## Libraries

**Active**

* [ColDet](https://sourceforge.net/projects/coldet/) - A collision detection library for generic polyhedra.
* [FCL](https://github.com/flexible-collision-library/fcl) ([github](https://github.com/flexible-collision-library/fcl)) - Flexible Collision Library.
* [libccd](https://github.com/danfis/libccd) ([github](https://github.com/danfis/libccd)) - Library for collision detection between two convex shapes.
* [OZCollide](http://www.tsarevitch.org/ozcollide/) - A fast, complete and free collision detection library.

> Note that some multibody dynamics libraries (e.g., ODE and Bullet) can be used only for collision detection.
